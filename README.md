# The Development of an End-to-End Autonomous Agent Software Project: A Journey Into the Unknown
This project serves as an introduction to a personally ambitious project focusing on the implementation and exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Autonomous Agents built on the LangChain framework. The objective is to design, develop, and deploy an end-to-end solution that leverages these cutting-edge technologies.

### Primary Objectives
The main objectives of this project after traditional planning are as follows:

1. Acquire a comprehensive understanding of Agents, Tools, and other essential components within the LangChain library.
2. Apply embeddings and vector stores for effective data representation and management.
3. Construct a product that employs autonomous discussions between agents to deliver a valuable service.
4. Track the progress
### Project Monitoring and Documentation
The progress and development of this project will be primarily stored within this repository. I believe Autonomous agents will contribute huge value if not a little scary!
